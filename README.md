# TTC Transit Delay Analysis

A comprehensive data visualization project analyzing Toronto Transit Commission (TTC) delay data across subway, streetcar, and bus services from 2023 to 2025.

## Project Overview

This project analyzes and visualizes TTC transit delay data to identify patterns, trends, and insights across different modes of transportation. The analysis includes:

- Delay patterns across subway, streetcar, and bus services
- Temporal analysis (hourly, daily, monthly trends)
- Station/route-level delay analysis
- Incident type analysis
- Delay and gap correlation studies
